This is the full stack web applciation website for recipe.

The goal was to design and implement a responsive and accessible web application for a local celebrity chef. The web app had to allow users to register, log in, search for recipes, and save their favourites.  Thet tasked is to using PHP for the server-side, HTML5, and JavaScript for the front-end, and MySQL for the database. Below is the dtail of the task

# Detail of the task
### Problem Specification â€“ Recipe Web Application 
A local celebrity chef has recruited your group to design and develop a web app for him. He has limited knowledge of web apps but has a vague idea of what he wants the web app to provide to users. After a brief discussion, the following basic requirements were agreed upon (next paragraphs). It will be your job to implement the web application in the following tasks. He has given you some flexibility to design the web app as you see fit, as long as it meets the basic specification that he provided.

The web app should be responsive and accessible, in order to be useable by a wide variety of users. The web app should use a MySQL database to store data (e.g., on users and recipes) and be user-friendly.

The web app should allow users to register and log in. Users should be able to search for recipes according to a range of different criteria, and you should make the web app as flexible as possible so that recipes can be found and sorted in different ways. The more diverse your search is (and ordering of results), the better the web app will be, so you can be creative about how this aspect works. Users should also be able to save their favourite recipes, to be accessed on an account page. The web app should also store some information on each user (including their name and email but also anything else you deem relevant).

Each recipe contains, as a minimum, one or more categories (e.g., starter, main, meat, vegetarian etc.), a list of ingredients and quantities, a sequence of steps to be followed and an amount of time per step. You can consider which other data could be stored for each recipe in order to allow more flexible searching and ordering of recipes and to make using the web app an enjoyable experience. He also suggested the idea for users to be able to rate each recipe. This could be an overall rating, or else broken down into categories (such as difficulty, aesthetics, taste etc.) which could feed into the search and ordering of results. 

### Tasks

In this assignment, you are required to implement a dynamic web application for the Recipe Web App, which will allow users to search for recipes, according to various search criteria as discussed above. He would like the search functionality to be as flexible as possible so that users can easily find suitable recipes.

The web app should be populated with reasonable sample data. You are required to include at least 5 recipes from the following list from BBC Food:

    Spaghetti Bolognese
    Vegan Pancakes
    Healthy Pizza
    Easy Lamb Biryani
    Couscous Salad
    Plum clafoutis
    Mango Pie
    Mushroom Doner

The web app should use PHP and run on an Apache Web Server via XAMPP, using the Visual Code as the development environment. You will also be required to implement a MySQL database via MySQL Workbench containing representative sample data for the purposes of testing your site and to connect to this MySQL database from your server-side code.

The PHP application will be using version 7 or 8 of this language. The application is required to present the application front-end user interface to the user using a combination of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The user interface should be dynamically generated using PHP web development techniques.

The web application will be assessed via Windows and a recent version of the Google Chrome web browser. The client-side user interface should NOT utilise any front-end web frameworks to render the HTML5 markup that comprises the content and structure of the site. The site should be styled using CSS3 and work with both Mobile and Desktop clients. JavaScript MUST be used for the client-side behaviour of your application.
